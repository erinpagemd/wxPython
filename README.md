wxPython
========

This is my "Hello, World" project. I am creating an application where a person can plan out how to spend their paychecks.

First Iteration Plan:
Add Income and Expenses
  
  StepOne: Created a test database in MongoDB
  StepTwo: Linked together MongoDB and PyThon
  StepThree: Created a GUI using wxPython
  StepFour: Display information captured by GUI
  StepFive: Add new record to database

Second Iteration Plan:
See a summary of entries
  StepOne: Query the database
  StepTwo: What does that have to become to show in GUI??
  
  #Separate screen for this?
  Create a table, and then have separate queries in each field indicating a query, sort, and show nth result in this box. 
  

Third Iteration Plan:
Edit entries
Link together Incomes and Expenses
